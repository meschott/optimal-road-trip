This repository contains a slight modification from the project created by rhiever. They contain the ability to do a route that starts and ends at the same place. It's not necessarily an improvement on the original code just merely used it for my own needs which is why I didn't try and merge the fork. 
This is the order of commands:

#only needs to be done for each set of waypoints
python build_waypoints.py

#the main work
python Genetic_Algorithm.py

#Produces the commands that must be pasted into the html
python calc_route_maker.py

#The first entry from each calcRoute must be entered into the two separate sets of case statements as well as the calcRoutes get pasted over 
open scamp_trip.html
